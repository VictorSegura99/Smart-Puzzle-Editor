Smart! is a little prototype made by Víctor Segura Blanco.

Its original intent was to serve as a Puzzle Editor Tool for my Final Work for my Videogames College Degree, but the circumstances
made me change my opinion and start again with another project, but with the same porpouse as the first one.
